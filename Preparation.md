## Questions to know the answer to:
- What is the variability?
- How can we quantify the data? (Validation I guess)
- Diverse Data
- modality
  
## Things to do:
- Evaluate on other datasets

## For the presentation:

- Well defined motivation

" Developing a machine learning model for human activity recognition in smart homes generates synthetic sensor data to address the challenges of acquiring extensive real-world datasets. Leveraging a limited initial dataset, the model creates synthetic data to simulate longer periods, thus enabling advanced models to benefit from larger datasets and enhance performance. "
